Introduction
------------
This capstone project was completed as part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track. The project explores 
a publicly available dataset of depersonalized patient data and cervical cancer outcomes. The following topics 
are covered in the report and project presentation of this repository (in the "reports" directory):

* Motivations and Dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Statistical Inference
* Machine Learning Models
* Conclusions
