    "The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on\n",

    "during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities.\n",
    "However, a toll bridge, with a two way\n",
    "toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend\n",
    "to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have\n",
    "proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by\n",
    "reimbursing all toll costs.\n",
    "1. What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiment in\n",
    "encouraging driver partners to serve both cities, and why would you choose this metric?\n",
    "2. Describe a practical experiment you would design to compare the effectiveness of the\n",
    "proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. Please provide details on:\n",
    "a. how you will implement the experiment\n",

    "Ultimate is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, we have\n",
    "provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an Ultimate account in\n",
    "January 2014. The data was pulled several months later; we consider a user retained if they\n",
    "were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days.\n",
    "We would like you to use this data set to help understand what factors are the best predictors\n",
    "for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Ultimate.\n",
    "The data is in the attached file ultimate_data_challenge.json. See below for a detailed\n",
    "description of the dataset. Please include any code you wrote for the analysis and delete the\n",
    "dataset when you have finished with the challenge.\n",
    "1. Perform any cleaning, exploratory analysis, and/or visualizations to use the provided\n",
    "data for this analysis (a few sentences/plots describing your approach will suffice). What\n",
    "fraction of the observed users were retained?\n",
    "2. Build a predictive model to help Ultimate determine whether or not a user will be active\n",
    "in their 6th month on the system. Discuss why you chose your approach, what\n",
    "alternatives you considered, and any concerns you have. How valid is your model?\n",
    "Include any key indicators of model performance.\n",
