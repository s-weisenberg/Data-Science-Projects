Introduction
------------
This capstone project was completed as part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track. The project explores 
a publicly available dataset: Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones. The following topics are covered in
the report and project presentation of this repository (in the "reports" directory):

* Background
* Data Set
* Data Preprocessing/Feature Engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis
	* Plotting Example Sensor Data
	* Visualizing Separability of Classes
		* PCA
		* tSNE
* Statistical Analysis
	* Aggregating Data
	* Selecting Features of Interest
	* Visualizing Distributions of Aggregated Feature Statistics
	* Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing
		* Motivation
		* Performing Hypothesis Tests
* Machine Learning Preprocessing
	* Splitting the Data: Training and Test Sets
	* Feature Scaling
	* Categorical Class Encoding
* Fitting an SVM Model
	* Hyperparameter Tuning
	* Model Evaluation
	* Visualizing Misclassified Activities
* Fitting a Neural Network Model
	* Importing the Raw Data
	* Preprocessing
	* Fitting an RNN Model
	* Fitting Additional RNN Models with Convolution
	* Comparison to SVM
* Conclusions
